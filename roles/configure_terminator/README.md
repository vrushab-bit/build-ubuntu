# Configure Terminator

## Overview
The **Configure Terminator** role automates the installation and configuration of the Terminator terminal emulator on Ubuntu systems. Terminator allows users to manage multiple terminal sessions in a single window, enhancing productivity through its advanced features.

## Responsibilities
- Installs the Terminator terminal emulator using the package manager.
- Copies a pre-defined configuration file to the user's home directory, ensuring that Terminator starts with user-specific settings.

## Tasks
1. **Install Terminator**: 
   - Uses the `apt` module to install Terminator if it is not already present on the system.

   ```yaml
   - name: "Install Terminator"
     ansible.builtin.apt:
       name: terminator
       update_cache: true
       state: present
     become: true
     become_method: ansible.builtin.sudo
     become_user: root
     when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"
   ```

2. **Copy Terminator Config File**: 
   - Copies a pre-defined configuration file from the role's files directory to the user's home directory, ensuring that Terminator is configured according to user preferences.

   ```yaml
   - name: "Copy Terminator Config File"
     ansible.builtin.copy:
       src: files/terminator_config
       dest: "{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/.config/terminator/config"
       owner: "{{ ansible_env.USER }}"
       group: "{{ ansible_env.USER }}"
       mode: "0644"
     become: false
   ```

## Usage
This role can be included in your main playbook as follows:

```yaml
- name: Configure Terminator for users
  hosts: all
  roles:
    - configure_terminator
```

## Requirements 
- Ansible must be installed on the control node.
- The target machine must be running Ubuntu and have internet access to download packages.
